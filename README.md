# First-Django-Project

<h1>Hello there</h1>
<h2>welcome to my blog</h2>
<p>This is my first django project that is being hosted on <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/">heroku<a/>. This project has the following built in:
<ul>
  <li>create user</li>
  <li>comment</li>
  <li>share link to others via email</li>
</ul>
All this was achieveable with the use of django and SMTP server(<a href="mailgun.com">mailgun</a>).
 Not to bore you much, <a href="https://djangoblac.herokuapp.com/2021/4/27/welcome-to-my-blog/">here is a link to my blog</a>. Please leave a comment below.
